This is the module for accesing Postgresql database from IDL. 
It was mostly written by Erin Sheldon. 
I have extracted it from sdssidl and made the installation simpler.


INSTALLATION: 
The only pre-requisite is that you have to download the postgresql tarball
from http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/ and put it in this directory. 

After that run
   make

This will create the directory called DLM which will have a dynamically
loadable IDL module. 
You can put this directory anywhere and add the path to it to the 
environmental variable IDL_DLM_DIR, e.g.
export IDL_DLM_DIR=some_path/DLM


After that in any IDL session you should be able to use pgsql_query()
function
